    \resumeItem{Developed a fault-tolerant network file transfer application, as measured by error-free transfer
    on unreliable systems, by designing a packet-level protocol over UDP that handles retranmissions, timeouts, and disk-write errors.}
    \resumeItem{Ensured protocol reliability by stress-testing 10+ GB directory transfers under packet duplication, drops, reordering, and artificial delay, 
    as well as simulated disk-level faults like slow or failed block reads/writes.}
    \resumeItem{Improved protocol tunability by implementing a modular class hierarchy that reduced code duplication and enabled precise control of client-server packet handling.}
