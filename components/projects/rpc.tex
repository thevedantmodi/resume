\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Designed a transparent remote procedure call generator supporting
	arbitrary C++ function prototypes, verified by successful invocation of
	functions with large arguments across networks. }
\resumeItem{Ensured reliable structured data recovery across TCP's stream
abstraction, as measured by correct deserialization across various test cases
such as nested structs and arrays, by designing a text protocol that encodes
explicit lengths for all variable-size fields and handles partial reads.
