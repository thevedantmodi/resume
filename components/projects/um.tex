\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Created a Turing Complete virtual machine by \textbf{implementing a
		custom memory subsystem} with a segment table supporting dynamic allocation
	and deallocation, separated functionality using \textbf{object-oriented
		programming techniques} into I/O, machine arithmetic, and
	logic; validated correctness with a custom unit-testing framework.
}
\resumeItem{Optimized the program by analyzing x86-64 Assembly instructions
	and \texttt{qcachegrind} and minimized expensive operations such as
	dereferencing or allocation through reuse of memory; verified performance
	gains via benchmarking against \textbf{1,000,000,000+ instruction} binaries}
%   \resumeItem{Recreated the venerable HP15-C via Assembly instructions derived from
