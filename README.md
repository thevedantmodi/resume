# Resume
This is a working document that represents my resume. Branches of this repository will be the different semesters/versions that I need a resume for. Resumes are broken down by what the role is, e.g. an AI role will have the projects that are most associated with an AI role.
## Naming of branches
Branches will be named by the company name and the job, as shown below.
```
tufts-cs/comp15CA
```
## Publishing my Resume
One can see my resume build up over time, as I archive it in this repository's RELEASES tab. Please browse over there if you want to see this information.
I also publish a copy of the resume to a GitHub pages site, in order to maintain a link that is reponsive to any edits I make.
## Building the workflow
To publish my resume, I use a combination of several GitHub actions. If you would like to see how I maintain this, and use in your own work, please see the `~/.github/` directory in this repository.
## Licensing
The workflows part of this repository lives under the GPLv3 license, as I worked a little hard to make it all piece together, and would like some credit if anyone reuses it.
